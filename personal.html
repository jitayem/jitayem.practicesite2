        <h2>Please find a list below of my top interest:</h1>
        <ol>
        	<li><p><em>I</em> have dabbled in two different careers since the time I have enrolled in college. After time spent in both careers I have gained experience that would help in either career. After taking the time involving myself in both careers, I have decided to go more the hair route. I enjoy making people feel beautiful and the art of cutting and coloring hair. <p></li>
        	<li><p><em>I</em> like doing hair because it is an art and there can be so many different outcomes. You meet various different personalities and build long relationships with clientele who trust you.<p></li>
			<li><p><em>I</em> enjoyed teaching because I felt as if I helped others. It was also nice being able to help students learn new topics and help them accomplish their goals.<p></li>
			<li><p><em>I</em> am passionate about all around wellness and doing what makes you happy. Hair goes hand in hand with making one confident.<p></li>
			<li><p>In my off time, <em>I</em> like to spend time with family, go to the gym, and cooking. I am outgoing and love meeting new people.  <p></li>
